# FizzBuzz

The FizzBuzz problem is a classic test given in coding interviews. Based on a childrenâ€™s word game that helps teach division, the FizzBuzz problem is simple: 
- Print integers 1-to-N, but print `Fizz` if an integer is `divisible by 3`,
- `Buzz` if an integer is `divisible by 5`, and
- `FizzBuzz` if an integer is `divisible by both 3 and 5`.
- Numbers are printed in case any numbers are not divisible by both 3 or 5.

For this project, I used **RStudio** and **Jupyter Notebook**.
