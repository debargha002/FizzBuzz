# FizzBuzz

The FizzBuzz problem is a classic test given in coding interviews. Based on a children’s word game that helps teach division, the FizzBuzz problem is simple: Print integers one-to-N, but print “Fizz” if an integer is divisible by 3, “Buzz” if an integer is divisible by 5, and “FizzBuzz” if an integer is divisible by both 3 and 5. Numbers are printed in case any numbers are not divisible by both 3 or 5.

For this project, I used RStudio v2023.06.02+561 
The original version is done in Rstudio with the extension as a R markdown(.rmd) file. Later, I converted it into pdf using LaTeX.

As we cannot run a markdown file with inline output here, so i converted it into a .R file.
